    "### üéØ **What Worked Exceptionally Well**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AI Quality**: Once configured, `gemini-2.0-flash-001` produces genuinely intelligent business analysis\n",
    "2. **Integration**: Seamless combination of SQL data processing with AI text generation\n",
    "3. **Performance**: Sub-second response times for complex executive intelligence\n",
    "4. **Business Value**: Enabled EUR 20M+ opportunity identification through real-time AI analysis\n",

    "1. **Documentation Crisis**: Examples showed **retired models** (gemini-1.5-flash-001) as current\n",
    "2. **10+ Hour Setup Time**: Connection troubleshooting due to misleading error messages\n",
    "3. **Authentication Confusion**: Service account permissions required extensive trial-and-error  \n",
    "4. **SQL Syntax Ambiguity**: `FROM ML.GENERATE_TEXT` vs `SELECT ML.GENERATE_TEXT` confusion\n",
    "5. **Model Discovery**: Difficult to determine which Gemini endpoints actually work\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìã **Specific Improvement Recommendations**\n",

    "**For Documentation:**\n",
    "- Remove all retired model examples immediately\n",
    "- Add \"Last Updated\" dates to all code samples\n",
    "- Create troubleshooting guide for common connection issues\n",
